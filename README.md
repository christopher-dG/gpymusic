## Dependencies

* [Python >= 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* [mpv](https://mpv.io)

## Installation

The easiest way to install is with `pip` by running `pip3 install gpymusic`.

You can also install from source:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/christopher-dG/gpymusic
$ cd gpymusic
$ python setup.py install
```

A special thanks goes to [ftxrc](https://github.com/ftxrc)
for his work on the `pip` installation.

## Configuration

Once `gpymusic` is installed, run `gpymusic-setup`.
An example config file will be placed in `~/.config/gpymusic`.

### Device ID

If you don't know your device ID, run `gpymusic-get-dev-id`
and follow the prompts to generate a list of valid device IDs.

### Password

You can choose to leave the password field empty and you will be
prompted for it upon starting the program. Otherwise, you can supply
it for automatic logins.

**If you store your password in plain text,
be aware the potential consequences.**

### Colours

Colour themes are defined in the `colour` section of your config file.
To enable colour, make sure `enable` is set to `yes` and set the fields
to hex colours as desired. `highlight` affects the section headers and
'now playing' output, `content{1|2}` affect the main window, and
`background`/`foreground` are self-explanatory.

Setting `background` to `default` allows you to use your terminal background
colour, which means this allows transparency if your terminal supports it.

**Note**: Upon exiting the program, your terminal colours will likely
be modified. Just open a new terminal session and your colours will
be back to normal.

### Now Playing

To log the currently playing track to a file, include a `nowplaying` section in
your config file with `enable` set to `yes`. A `filename` may then be specified,
or the default value of `~/.nowplaying` will be used.

This file may then be used in status bars or simple notifications systems. For
example, here is a simple i3blocks definition:

```
[music]
command=cat ~/.nowplaying
interval=5
```

## Running Google Py Music

Once installed and configured, the program can be run from the terminal
with `gpymusic`. While the program is running, don't resize your terminal.

## Controls

* `s/search search-term`: Search for `search-term`
* `e/expand 123`: Expand item number `123`
* `p/play`: Play the current queue
* `p/play s`: Shuffle and play the current queue
* `p/play 123`: Play item number `123`
* `q/queue`: Show the current queue
* `q/queue 123`:  Add item number `123` to queue
* `q/queue 1 2 3`:  Add items `1`, `2`, and `3` to the queue
* `q/queue c`:  Clear the current queue
* `radio 123`: Create radio station around item number `123`
* `w/write playlist-name`: Write the current queue to playlist `playlist-name`
* `r/restore playlist-name`: Replace the current queue with a playlist
  from `file-name`
* `h/help`: Show help message
* `Ctrl-C`: Exit Google Py Music

When playing music:

* `spc`: Play/pause
* `9/0`: Volume down/up (Note: volume changes are not persistent across songs,
  so I recommend that you adjust your system volume instead)
* `n`: Next track
* `q`: Stop
* `↑/↓/←/→`: Seek

## Accounts

Google Py Music works similarly to the web interface in that users with
free accounts can only arbitrarily access music that they've purchased or
uploaded, whereas users with paid accounts can search for and stream anything.
When playing music with a free account, the entire song is downloaded and
played locally rather than streamed.

Notes for free users:

* A one-time OAuth2 sign-in is required for free users, run
  `gpymusic-oauth-login` and follow the prompts to authorize.
* If you don't want to wait for songs to download on the fly, you can download
  them all in one go by running `gpymusic-download-all`.
  Songs are stored in `~/.local/share/gpymusic/songs`.
* The `e/expand` command does not work for free users because artists and
  albums cannot be generated, so there is nothing for it to do.
* I don't have enough music uploaded to my free account to properly test it,
  so please open issues about any crashes or other problems.

## 2-Factor Authentication

If your account has 2FA set up, you will need to use an
[app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
to log in. If you're storing your password in your config file,
replace it with the app password.

## Crashes

If `gpymusic` crashes, your terminal settings will likely be messed up,
in which case `stty sane` will restore order. Don't forget to open an issue!

Thanks for using Google Py Music!
